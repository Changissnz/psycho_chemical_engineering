# Introduction
Once upon a time, there was a genius that invented the term "social engineering". This term "social engineering" really revolutionized my thinking. 
Before I heard this term, I thought the field of engineering was, you know, very scientifically and logically verified, and that the products yielded
from serious engineering projects was stable and long-lasting. I thought I had standards. But when the word of the genius came to me to enable me to
discover social engineering, I finally mustered the courage to admit that I was wrong. Engineering Qengineering Rengineering Pengineering, and the
list goes on and on. Ever since I heard the word of the genius, I have seen such... different engineering standards. Engineering as a means to deceive
and destroy. Engineering as a means to guarantee an output, usually with dramatic losses and gains for the receiving ends. Engineering as a control system.
Engineering as a product that does not serve everyone. Engineering as manipulation. 

# What is this new kind of engineering?
Psycho-chemical engineering is the application of chemicals to alter the mental state of a person to increase the probability that they will think, act, and behave
in a certain way. These chemicals may be psychotropic, or may induce biological processes in an individual so that their mental state is altered. There are no
constraints to what outcomes are desired by this type of engineer. 

# Plans
I have no plans for this project. I think this field, "Psycho Chemical Engineering", would greatly fascinate psychiatrists, psychologists, applied chemists,
those people.
